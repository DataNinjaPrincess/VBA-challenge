Data Analytics VBA homework Week 2

The purpose of this code is to summarize stock trading data in order to determine the change from the first opening of the year until the last closing, in both dollars and as a percent, as well as computing the total traded volume.

Additionally, it determines the stock with the greatest percent increase, percent decrease, and trading volume for each year.

The TickerSummary file contains three different subroutines.  The first, Ticker, produces the summary in columns I-L, as well as calls Greatest.  Greatest populates the greatest percent increase, percent decrease, and total volume in columns O-Q

Additionally, the file contains the subroutine Reset, which clears both text and formatting from columns I-Q, so the code can be rerun on a clean environment.
