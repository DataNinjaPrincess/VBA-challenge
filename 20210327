' Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

' The ticker symbol.

' Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

' The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

' The total stock volume of the stock.

' You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

' Your solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". The solution will look as follows:

' Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
